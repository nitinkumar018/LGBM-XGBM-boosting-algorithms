# LGBM-XGBM-boosting-algorithms
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Build predictive models using LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms.
## Choose appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for model evaluation.
## Use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
## Compare the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of LightGBM and XGBoost models.
## A brief report summarizing the comparative analysis results and practical implications.
## plot various features of LightGBM and XGBoost models
